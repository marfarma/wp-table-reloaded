== Description ==

This plugin allows you to create and manage tables in the admin-area of WordPress. You can then show them in your posts or on your pages by using a shortcode. The plugin is greatly influenced by the plugin "WP-Table" by Alex Rabe, but was completely rewritten and uses the state-of-the-art WordPress techniques which makes it faster and lighter than the original plugin.
	
== Installation ==

1. Extract the zip file and just drop the folder "wp-table-reloaded" into the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation.

2. Activate the Plugin "WP-Table Reloaded" on your "Plugins" page.

3. Create and manage tables via "WP-Table Reloaded" in the "Tools" section.

4. Include a table by adding the shortcode [table id=<your-table's-id> /] to your post or page.

5. You might want to add styling features via your blog's theme's CSS file (probably style.css).

Notes: The plugin is currently in beta state. Most of the frontend functionality is not yet implemented, but the admin-area is fully functional.

Also: Multi-language support is implemented, but no languages besides English are available so far. I will add German as a language in one of the next releases. If you want to add another language, I recommend using Heiko Rabe's plugin "Codestyling Localization" which can be found on http://www.code-styling.de/.
